# hackthehackathon
With so many hackers and scams, welcome to hack the hackathon. Airdrop? Probably not. Why? Some builders aren't eligible for their code even as US residents (understandable), then no one is allowed in this one. This just just the front for now. The real one is in the back, and will not be televised. Offchain summer.
